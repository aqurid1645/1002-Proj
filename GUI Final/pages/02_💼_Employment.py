    st.write("""From the Sunburst graph that is shown, it is clear that during the year of 2020 when the pandemic was at its peak,
there was a plunge in the employment status in the services industry. This could mainly be due to the lock down that Singapore was going through. 
On top of that, many brick and mortar stores were struggling to make ends meet. It was also clear that most of the non-residents were worst off,
as many of them were forced to go back to their respective countries due to the inability of companies extending their employment passes.

However, in 2021 when the pandemic was subsiding, there was an exponential increment in the service industry. 
The main reason for this could be that Singapore was transitioning back to it status quo and these businesses required to re-employ employees. 
On top of that, the Singapore government was also granting many businesses grants and waivers to cushion the financial impact.""")
